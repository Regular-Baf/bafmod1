# Bafmaster's "Literally Just a Katana" Mod
A simple, but fun mod for Minecraft that adds one thing, and one thing only: a katana. It slices, it dices, and that's about it. Awaken your inner archeologist and you might just find the katana in a desert well, or failing that, it can be crafted with some iron, gold, and a few red carpets.
## I'm sold, but what are the specs?
* 6 Attack damage, with a 2.5 attack speed.
* The same durability as an iron sword, hopefully.
* 16x16 Texture resolution.
* Optional, but cool 3D katana model, increasing the fear of your enemies by 69%
* Available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/bafmod1)!

## Requires
* Minecraft 1.20.1
* Fabric for 1.20.1
* The Fabric Kotlin Extension
* Fabric API (I think, most mods do?)

### Also of interest...
What perhaps makes this mod somewhat special is that it was written nearly entirely by ChatGPT, which I as someone with no knowledge of Java or Kotlin, was able to make function. If you take the time out of your day to try it out, I hope it brings you some joy.
Also, the 2D katana texture was made mostly by Stable Diffusion 2.1 using [this](https://huggingface.co/Plixel-AI/Plixel) lora. Check it out, it's quite fancy!
