# Bafmaster's "Literally Just a Katana" Mod
A pretty small and basic mod for Minecraft that adds one thing, and one thing only: a katana. It slices, it dices, and that's about it (you can craft it too!). What perhaps makes this mod somewhat special is that it was written nearly entirely by ChatGPT, which I as someone with no knowledge of Java or Kotlin, was able to make function. If you take the time out of your day to try it out, I hope it brings you some joy.

## Requires
* Minecraft 1.20
* Whatever Fabric version works in 1.20
* Fabric Kotlin Extension
* Fabric API (I think, most mods do?)

### Also of interest...
The katana texture was made mostly by Stable Diffusion 2.1 using [this](https://huggingface.co/Plixel-AI/Plixel) lora. Check it out, it's quite fancy!
